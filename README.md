# What's this project about ? 

Climatology is essentially a catalog of weather info across 120k locations. Inside you'll learn about the climate facts of each location and look up its current weather conditions. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). Please refer to Contributing.md for the setup. 

## Feature wishlist 
- Because there are still big cities that are still missing, we wanted to make a function which can allow users to just type in the location name, and the app will run a check whether the database already has that location and push the location to the database.
- Future location specificity update: There are more than 10 cities in the world with the same name (Portland, Richmond, Fremont, etc.). In order to tell these cities apart, we'll be adding first admin division to each city in the near future. 
- Add a plot of daylight hours in the temperature section. Source: https://www.dataliftoff.com/plotting-hours-of-daylight-in-python-with-matplotlib/
