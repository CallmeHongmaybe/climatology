# What's this project about ? 

Climatology is essentially a catalog of weather info across 120k locations. Inside you'll learn about the climate facts of each location and look up its current weather conditions. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). Please refer to Contributing.md for the setup. 

If you're interested in how the project is built, do pay a visit to my [blog post](https://denniskwan.vercel.app/posts/climatology). 

## Feature wishlist 
- Because there are still big cities that are still missing, we wanted to make a function which can allow users to just type in the location name, and the app will run a check whether the database already has that location and push the location to the database.
- Add a plot of daylight hours in the temperature section. Source: https://www.dataliftoff.com/plotting-hours-of-daylight-in-python-with-matplotlib/
